## End-to-end (E2E) encryption

In order for E2EE features to work, [libolm][] must be available on the system
`PATH` or located alongside the executable
(cshrix calls into it using P/Interop).

### Linux

Check if your distro's package manager has [libolm][] available.
It usually goes under the name `libolm` and/or `libolm-dev`.

#### Debian/Ubuntu

Debian: buster/sid and later.

Ubuntu: 18.04 (bionic) and later.

```
# apt install libolm-dev
```

#### Arch

[`libolm` is available in the AUR][libolm-aur] and as a
[git version][libolm-git-aur].


### Windows

As of right now (2019-04-23), no official Windows releases of [libolm][] exist.
Build the library manually and place it either somewhere on the `PATH` or
alongside the executable.

### macOS

Unknown. If someone has information about [libolm][] on macOS, please make
a [PR][] and update this section.
